# Introduction
Please don't re-invent things, if you are not sure about certain elements then explore or find a proper inspiration, re-inventing elements that do not exist is not recommended. Try to not mix 5 styles into one, it's almost impossible to do that as the website should be simple for every user from 9 to 99 years old.



## Project
Please find 5 (five) random modern websites, self-assessed and share with your mentor to pick 1 (one).

- 5 to 7 pages should be re-designed 
    - please use different layouts, copying 1 thing 5 times isn't an acceptable solution
    - decide what fonts to use (use only google.fonts)
    - a website should keep color styles but it isn't `a must`
- devices design should be done for 2 pages per device
    - desktop view size: 1920 x 9999
    - tablet view size: 768 x 9999
    - mobile view size: 412 x 9999
- icons should be replaced with fontawesome icon sets, please use SVGs instead of PNGs
- this project is more about usability than anything else



## Presentation
The selected website should be presented via MarvelApp or via InvisionApp, the designer should also upload project files/visual to her/his Behance profile.



## Resources
The designer should replace copyright images/media, so here are resources for that:
* Photos: Unsplash.com
* Photos: Pixabay.com
* Icons: FontAwesome.com
* Fonts: fonts.google.com



## Tools 
A designer is free to decide what tools will be used: 
- Photoshop
- Figma
- Sketch
- Illustrator
- Affinity



## Deadline
You are free to schedule `time` however you want, but when you plan to `start` you must send a message to `mentor`, so we all know the timeline `when its starter` and `when it is finished` - time will be taken into consideration.
